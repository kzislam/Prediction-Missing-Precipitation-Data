# Prediction-Missing-Precipitation-Data
I am going to find hydrological changes in Humber River Watershed. I have downloaded historical weather data (precipitation) from Canada govt website (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment.html). But there are many missing value in those data. For that reason it is essential to estimate missing precipitation value.
Here 3 weather stations historical data (2020 year) downloaded. 
Est1 = Deer Lake, Est2 = Deer Lake Airport, Est3 = Cormack.
Here I am trying to estimate/predict the missing precipitation value of Deer Lake Airport
