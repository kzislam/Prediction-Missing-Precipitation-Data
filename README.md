# Prediction-Missing-Precipitation-Data
I am going to find hydrological changes in Humber River Watershed. I have downloaded historical weather data (precipitation) from Canada govt website (https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment.html). But there are many missing value in those data. For that reason it is essential to estimate missing precipitation value.
